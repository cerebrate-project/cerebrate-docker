# cerebrate-docker

A simple docker installation script package for Cerebrate

- init.sh, which takes care of downloading the latest version of the software, managing configurations and starting the solution by building the images;

- remove.sh which takes care of stopping the services, removing the available containers and removing the downloaded software so as to return to the initial clean situation;
   
- start.sh and stop.sh are docker-compose wrappers to increase ease of use.
